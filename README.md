# MovieRecommendation
This is a .NET MAUI application that allows the user to rate some movies and then generate a movie recommendation. It's a small project that the main goal was to study a movie recommendation algorithm in python but it was made an application to support and apply this algorithm in a real world situation.

I used Python.Net to implment the python script on the .NET project.

Here's a short video demonstrating the application, i didn't care much about the UI and front-end because that was not my main goal.

If you want to test by yourself you have to unzip the "similares" file on the Data folder and do some adaptations on the code to support your local file path.
